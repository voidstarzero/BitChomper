# BitChomper

An emulator for a custom virtual CPU architechture

## Building

First, clone the repository to your local environment

```
git clone https://github.com/voidstarzero/BitChomper.git
cd BitChomper
```

Next, configure your shell to use the project's custom build settings

```
. enter.sh
```

This adds project-specific settings to your shell/command interpreter,
such as adding the project build scripts to your path, and adding a
`<BC>` marker to your prompt to let you know the settings are enabled.

When you're done, you can reverse the changes by typing

```
. exit.sh
```
